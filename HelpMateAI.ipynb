Article 6 - Member Life Insurance - Coverage During Disability A Member may be eligible to continue his or her Member Life and Member Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance and Dependent Life Insurance coverage during the Member's ADL Disability or Total Disability. a. Coverage Qualification To be qualified for Coverage During Disability, a Member must: (1) become ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled while insured for Member Life Insurance; and (2) become ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled prior to the attainment of age 60; and (3) remain ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled continuously; and (4) be under the regular care and attendance of a Physician; and (5) send proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability to The Principal when required; and (6) submit to Medical Examinations or Evaluations when required; and (7) return to The Principal, without claim, any individual policy issued under his or her Individual Purchase Rights as described in PART III, Section F, Article 1. Upon return of such policy, The Principal will refund premiums paid, less dividends and less any outstanding policy loan balance. b. Proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability Written proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability must be sent to The Principal within one year of the date ADL Disability or Total Disability begins. Further proof that ADL Disability or Total Disability has not ended must be sent when The Principal requires. After ADL Disability or Total Disability has continued for two years from the date the first proof is received, The Principal may not ask for further proof more than once each year. If the Member dies while ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled, final proof that ADL Disability or Total Disability continued to the date of death must be sent to The Principal. If death occurs within one year of the start of ADL Disability or Total Disability, but before The Principal has received first proof, then final proof must be sent within one year of the date ADL Disability or Total Disability began. c. Medical Examinations and Evaluations This policy has been updated effective January 1, 2014 PART IV - BENEFITS GC 6013 Section A - Member Life Insurance, Page 4\", \"(1) marriage or establishment of a Civil Union partnership or divorce or termination of a Civil Union partnership; (2) death of a spouse or child; (3) birth or adoption of a child; (4) termination of employment by the Member's spouse or a change in the spouse's employment that causes loss of group coverage; (5) the Member's employment or the Member's spouse's employment changes from part- time to full-time or from full-time to part-time; (6) the Member or the Member's spouse takes an unpaid leave of absence. A change in the Scheduled Benefits because of a request by the Member when a change in family status has occurred for which Proof of Good Health is not required (see e. above) will normally be effective on the date of the request. However, if the Member is not Actively at Work on the date a Scheduled Benefit change would otherwise be effective, the Scheduled Benefit change will not be in force until the date the Member returns to Active Work. Any decrease in Scheduled Benefit amounts due to a request by the Member will be effective on the date of the change, whether or not the Member is Actively at Work. A change in the Scheduled Benefits because of a request by the Member when a change in family status has occurred for which Proof of Good Health is required (see e. above) will be effective on the later of: (1) the date the change would have been effective if Proof of Good Health had not been required; or (2) the date Proof of Good Health is approved by The Principal. Article 2 - Member Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance Member Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance will be effective under the same terms as set forth for Member Life Insurance in this Section B, Article 1.
